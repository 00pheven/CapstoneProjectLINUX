	Steven and I focused our attention on the process of making sure that we understood how Git worked.
	While I initially thought it would be uneventful, it proved to be a tad time consuming as I had
	forgot to fetch and pull properly, leading to merge errors.  Once we had figured those out, we both
	managed to figure it all out and come up with a system in order to prevent merge issues.

	I managed to show Steven how a few of the quirkier aspects of Git worked and how to link the libraries
	we need to make this possible.  He's picking things up extremely fast and now it looks as though we're
	about to really get started.  I am planning on joining back up with him on Monday once we've touched
	bases with Professor Moreno.  Right now, it all looks as though things are going to go smoothly now that
	we've managed to get everything up to speed.
