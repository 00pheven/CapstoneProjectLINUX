This is a log of all minor events that have occured within the Capstone Project so far.  As such,
this log is not designed for the end customer, but stands as a milestone within milestones to show
the dedication it took to go about a project of this scope.

1/28/20
	Steven and I focused our attention on the process of making sure that we understood how Git worked.
	While I initially thought it would be uneventful, it proved to be a tad time consuming as I had
	forgot to fetch and pull properly, leading to merge errors.  Once we had figured those out, we both
	managed to figure it all out and come up with a system in order to prevent merge issues.

	I managed to show Steven how a few of the quirkier aspects of Git worked and how to link the libraries
	we need to make this possible.  He's picking things up extremely fast and now it looks as though we're
	about to really get started.  I am planning on joining back up with him on Monday once we've touched
	bases with Professor Moreno.  Right now, it all looks as though things are going to go smoothly now that
	we've managed to get everything up to speed.

2/3/20
	Steven and I met with the professor to submit our first progress report.  So far, we are both up to speed
	and are able to begin working on our project.  We have plans to start and finish the window component before
	Friday the 14th.  I have plans on how to implement this, but we should be able to get this almost totally
	complete by then.  I am able to implement a whole working window for an engine in about 2 hours, so we
	should be totally prepared come Friday.
	
2/6/20
	Managed to apply almost all of the OpenGL initialization calls needed to make the engine work.  This was a
	big task that required a lot of reworking old conceptions I had about OpenGL, but if all goes well then
	the engine is prepped to draw 2D.  All I need to do is add additional features like input among other things
	so that the engine can really get going.
