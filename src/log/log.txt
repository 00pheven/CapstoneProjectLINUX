	Steven and I focused our attention on the process of making sure that we understood how Git worked.
	While I initially thought it would be uneventful, it proved to be a tad time consuming as I had
	forgot to fetch and pull properly, leading to merge errors.  Once we had figured those out, we both
	managed to figure it all out and come up with a system in order to prevent merge issues.
